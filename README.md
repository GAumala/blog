# My Blog [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/GAumala/blog.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/GAumala/blog)

This is a monorepo with all the source code needed to build my blog. It is 
organized into 5 directories. Here's what each of them contains:

- `./static/` The static site built with Hakyll. It's mostly posts written in 
  Markdown, the templates used to transform them into HTML, and some stylesheets 
  and fonts.
- `./api/` A Scotty web app used as backend for the blog.
