    <h1>Gabriel's Blog</h1>
    <p class="info"> Hi, I'm Gabriel, a guy in Ecuador interested in computers and
    programming. Most of my projects are open source and you can check them out
    on GitHub. Occasionally, I write stuff here.</p>

        <div class="date"><span>September 25, 2018</span></div>
        <p>In part 3 of <a href="./2018-09-03-is-this-finally-working-oh-hello-world.html">Building a Blog</a> I will talk about the implementation of the like button at the bottom of every post in this website. The goal is to have an interactive widget that lets users see the number of likes for the post they are currently reading and optionally increment it by one unit. It is written with <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">Mithril</a>, a modern JavaScript framework for fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single Page Applications</a>.</p>

        <p>In part 2 of <a href="./2018-09-03-is-this-finally-working-oh-hello-world.html">Building a Blog</a> I will talk about how the small HTTP API used by this blog was implemented. Once again, because I like Haskell, I’ll use the <a href="https://github.com/scotty-web/scotty">Scotty</a> web framework to listen to HTTP requests and run SQLite queries with the <a href="http://tathougies.github.io/beam/">Beam</a> library.</p>

        <div class="date"><span>September  7, 2018</span></div>
        <p>In part 1 of <a href="./2018-09-03-is-this-finally-working-oh-hello-world.html">Building a Blog</a> I will talk about how the static pages served in this blog are generated. Writing HTML for every posts is too low level and cumbersome. I don’t need to rewrite the structure of the page for every post. It’s better to write the content in a more high level language like markdown and convert it to HTML using a predefined template. Programs that are able to do this are usually called static site generators AKA just what I need.</p>

        <p>I’ve been wanting to have my own blog for a while now, and only recently I finally had the time to sit down and work on it. I think knowing how to write and communicate effectively is a very valuable skill, specially for somebody working in tech. I’m by no means a good writer, but here I am.</p>
